Hi, I’m Leah!
I’m a passionate tech student driven by a belief that technology can solve meaningful problems and create opportunities for everyone, especially those from underrepresented communities.

I’ve led coding workshops and programming clubs at my school, participated in national hackathons like JPMorgan Generation Tech, and am currently working on personal projects focused on inclusive tech-for-good solutions.

Currently learning: Python, data analysis, and web development. I’m fascinated by how technology intersects with healthcare, used in financial systems, education, protects digital systems and social mobility.

Projects coming soon:

A data visualisation project exploring local digital inequality

A web app designed to support young people learning to code

I’m always looking to learn, build, and collaborate with others who care about using tech to make a real difference.

CodePixle — A Web App for New Coders (Coming Soon)
About the project:
CodePixle is a beginner-friendly web app designed to help young people and students take their first steps in programming through interactive challenges and mini-projects.

Why I’m building this:
After hosting coding clubs and seeing the confidence it gave my classmates, I wanted to build a tool that extends that experience beyond the classroom, making coding fun, accessible, and supportive for everyone.

Tech stack:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Possibly Python (Flask) for backend

Status:
Planning and outlining core features — repository coming soon!
