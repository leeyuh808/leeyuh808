# Allow me to introduce myself — I’m Leah!
Aspiring **Quant Dev/Software or Data Engineer** | **FinTech Enthusiast** 
Passionate about building **human-centred, secure, and innovative** technologies that make a **real-world** impact espesically in the financial markets.

I’m currently studying a **T-Level in Software Development**. For me tech is about developing innovative, data-powered software that adapts to real-world needs and drives measurable results.


## Interests:
**Quant Development** → Engineering high-performance systems combining sofwtare engineering and mathematics to analyse financial data and support real-time decision-making

**Enterprise Data** → Working with enterprise data to address organisational challenges and deliver measurable impact

**Software Engineering** → Designing full-stack applications that adapt to user needs


## Highlights:
**JPMorgan Chase Generation Tech** → Programmed 3Pi robots using Arduino and C++, designing and debugging algorithms to efficiently map a black-line maze, optimising route selection afer exhausting all possible paths under strict time constraints.

**Tech Leadership** → Lead coding clubs and workshops, creating inclusive spaces where anyone (regardless of experience) can learn programming and build confidence.

**Full-Stack Projects** → Building a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) web application that automates calculations and visualises financial data using Python, JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS, with a strong focus on usability and accuracy.

**Resilience & Collaboration** → Thriving in **time-critical challenges** and **high stake situations** from hackathons to client-focused presentations, always delivering practical solutions while learning new technologies quickly.
