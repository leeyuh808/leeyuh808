# Hey there — I’m Leah!
Aspiring **Software Engineer** | **Data & Cybersecurity Enthusiast** | **Future Tech Consultant**
Passionate about building **human-centred, secure, and innovative** technologies that make a **real-world** impact.

I’m currently studying a **T Level in Digital Production, Design & Development** while leading coding clubs at school to inspire the next generation of technologists. For me, tech is not just about code — it’s about solving problems, connecting people, and creating systems that last.


## Interests:
**Software Engineering** → Designing full-stack applications that adapt to user needs
**Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking** → Exploring human and technical dimensions of digital resilience
**Tech Consulting** → Leveraging data-driven insights to solve client challenges at scale
**Inclusive Tech Outreach** → Running coding workshops that empower anyone to start their journey in tech


## Highlights:
**JPMorgan Chase Generation Tech** → Debugged and optimised code for a 3Pi robot using Arduino & C++ under strict time pressure, sparking a passion for real-world problem solving.
**Tech Leadership** → Lead coding clubs and workshops, creating inclusive spaces where anyone — regardless of experience — can learn programming and build confidence.
**Full-Stack Projects** → In the process of building a revision tracker & focus web app (Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS) designed around usability and motivation. Currently exploring mobile scalability.
**Resilience & Collaboration** → Thriving in **time-critical challenges** and **high stake situations** from hackathons to client-focused presentations, always delivering practical solutions while learning new technologies quickly.
