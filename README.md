# Allow me to introduce myself — I’m Leah!
Aspiring **Software/Data Engineer** | **FinTech Enthusiast** 
Passionate about building **human-centred, secure, and innovative** technologies that make a **real-world** impact espesically in the financial markets.

I’m currently studying a **T Level in Digital Production, Design & Development** while leading coding clubs at school to inspire the next generation of technologists. For me, tech is not just about code, it’s about solving problems, connecting people, and creating systems that last.


## Interests:
**Enterprise Data** → Working with enterprise data to address organisational challenges and deliver measurable impact

**Software Engineering** → Designing full-stack applications that adapt to user needs

**Inclusive Tech Outreach** → Running coding workshops that empower anyone to start their journey in tech


## Highlights:
**JPMorgan Chase Generation Tech** → Programmed 3Pi robots using Arduino and C++, designing and debugging algorithms to efficiently map a black-line maze, optimising route selection afer exhausting all possible paths under strict time constraints.

**Tech Leadership** → Lead coding clubs and workshops, creating inclusive spaces where anyone (regardless of experience) can learn programming and build confidence.

**Full-Stack Projects** → In the process of building a revision tracker & focus web app (Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS) designed around usability and motivation. Currently exploring mobile scalability.

**Resilience & Collaboration** → Thriving in **time-critical challenges** and **high stake situations** from hackathons to client-focused presentations, always delivering practical solutions while learning new technologies quickly.
