# Allow me to introduce myself — I’m Leah!
Aspiring **Software Engineer** | **Data & Cybersecurity Enthusiast** | **Future Tech Consultant**
Passionate about building **human-centred, secure, and innovative** technologies that make a **real-world** impact.

I’m currently studying a **T Level in Digital Production, Design & Development** while leading coding clubs at school to inspire the next generation of technologists. For me, tech is not just about code, it’s about solving problems, connecting people, and creating systems that last.


## Interests:
**Software Engineering** → Designing full-stack applications that adapt to user needs

**Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking** → Exploring human and technical dimensions of digital resilience

**Tech Consulting** → Leveraging data-driven insights to solve client challenges at scale

**Inclusive Tech Outreach** → Running coding workshops that empower anyone to start their journey in tech


## Highlights:
**JPMorgan Chase Generation Tech** → Debugged and optimised code for a 3Pi robot using Arduino & C++ under strict time pressure, sparking a passion for real-world problem solving.
**Tech Leadership** → Lead coding clubs and workshops, creating inclusive spaces where anyone (regardless of experience) can learn programming and build confidence.
**Full-Stack Projects** → In the process of building a revision tracker & focus web app (Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS) designed around usability and motivation. Currently exploring mobile scalability.
**Resilience & Collaboration** → Thriving in **time-critical challenges** and **high stake situations** from hackathons to client-focused presentations, always delivering practical solutions while learning new technologies quickly.
